                The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you
                balance
                the energy you consume with the energy you use.If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll
                put
                on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little,
                you'll
                lose weight.
